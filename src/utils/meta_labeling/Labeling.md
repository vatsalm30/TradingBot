# Meta Labeling

## Primary Model
- Use the novel pattern mining framework to get trades
- Compute when a successful trade occurs and when not
- Store all the data in a data frame


## Secondary Model
- Use several indicators: slope, adx, moving average crosses, trendline slope, distace from support/resistance to see if any thing is significant
- Visualize and compare the data to maximize profit
- Make sure not to over fit the data
